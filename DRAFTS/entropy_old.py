    At any point in Wordle, there are poss possible solution words given a new guess
    with its associated guessmap (base-10 int), where E is a subset of poss.

    For any guessword, there are 3^5 possible guessmaps (0-242) as the solution word
    is unknown. Each guessmap has a probability p of occuring given the guessword.
    This p is found as the number of possibilities poss that fit the guessword over
    all possibilities 12792.
