class HashTableWordle():
    """
    Hash Table of 12972 allowed * 2315 solution words = 30030180 key-value pairs

    Stores the 5-element integer list associated with each pair of guessed and 
    correct word. The int list elements can be:
        0 = green
        1 = yellow
        2 = grey

    There will be an int list for all *possible* guessed-correct word pairs
    for Wordle.

    This is computationally intensive but dramatically decreases the actual
    Wordle simulation's runtime as the colour map for each pair of guessed and
    correct word is already computed and stored here.

    This Hash Table has a method to add a word pair and corresponding int list,
    and a method to search the Hash Table for the int list of a specific pair.
